All this task will refer to the same example project. 

This project is divided in two process, first is a prediction process one to make predictions and one to collect metrics. 
This two process are called workflows. 

The prediction workflow is divided into three nodes, first the input message is formatted, then an AI model performs a 
prediction, and finally the prediction is formatted to a desired output.

The second workflow is used to match real world data with past predictions to be used in data analysis to monitor model
performance.   

Now you know the example project, these are the task you need to do in order to create a KRT file.
