Here you will learn how to program a node in different languages. Currently, KRE supports Python and Golang. 


## Python

TODO: show example python code.  


## Golang 

TODO: show example golang code.  



### Compiling binaries

KRE provides support for nodes running Golang code, but currently you need to compile the binary before generating the 
KRT file. This may be also automated in future releases. 

Compile your binary for the architecture you need (amd/arm) and reference the resulting binary from your `krt.yml`.
